# Feature development workflow

## Quick Tasks

### [X] Step: Modify Frontend Signup to Use Backend API
Modified frontend signup code to call backend's `/signup` endpoint instead of Supabase Auth:
- Updated `js/supabase-auth-manager.js` signup method to use `fetch()` to backend API
- Updated `signup.html` inline signup handler to use `fetch()` to backend API
- Both now call `https://synk-web.onrender.com/signup` and store the returned JWT token in localStorage
- Fixed auth state management to use correct localStorage keys (`synk_auth_token` and `synk_user_email`)
- Added auth state change event dispatch to show account icon after signup

## Workflow Steps

### [ ] Step: Requirements

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects. For unclear aspects: - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if: - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications - No reasonable default exists - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

```

Save the PRD into `c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-web\.zencoder\chats\3728b0eb-93dc-41dc-b6d1-0d5cdd4466a2/requirements.md`.

### [ ] Step: Technical Specification

Based on the PRD in `c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-web\.zencoder\chats\3728b0eb-93dc-41dc-b6d1-0d5cdd4466a2/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-web\.zencoder\chats\3728b0eb-93dc-41dc-b6d1-0d5cdd4466a2/spec.md`.

### [ ] Step: Implementation Plan

Based on the technical spec in `c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-web\.zencoder\chats\3728b0eb-93dc-41dc-b6d1-0d5cdd4466a2/spec.md`, create a detailed task plan and update `c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-web\.zencoder\chats\3728b0eb-93dc-41dc-b6d1-0d5cdd4466a2/plan.md`. Each task should have task definition, references to contracts to be used/implemented, deliverable definition and verification instructions.

Format each task as

```
### [ ] Step: <task_name>
Task instructions
```
