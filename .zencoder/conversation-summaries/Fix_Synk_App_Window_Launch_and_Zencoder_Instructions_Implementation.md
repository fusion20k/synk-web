üîπ Steps for Zencoder to Fix the App Window Launch
Check BrowserWindow creation in main-oauth-fixed.js (or whatever main process file is launching Electron):
Ensure the window is actually being created:
```
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  width: 1200,
  height: 800,
  backgroundColor: '#111111',
  frame: false,               // for custom border
  webPreferences: {
    preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
    contextIsolation: true,
    nodeIntegration: false
  }
});

mainWindow.loadFile('src/index.html'); // load the correct renderer
mainWindow.on('ready-to-show', () => mainWindow.show());

```
Missing mainWindow.show() or misconfigured path can make the app appear ‚Äústuck.‚Äù
Check for async blocks before window creation:
If the code waits on something (e.g., SyncManager init, token fetch) before creating the UI, move window creation before the sync initialization.
Example order:
```
const mainWindow = createWindow(); // create UI immediately
initializeSyncManager();           // start syncing after window is visible

```
Validate renderer path:
Make sure src/index.html is the latest standalone UI.
If loadFile points to an old or missing file, Electron will hang.
Handle uncaught errors:
Add this in the main process to catch silent errors that block UI:
```
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
});

```
Dev mode considerations:
Ensure that in development, DEMO_MODE uses localhost redirect URIs, but window creation should not be conditional on any OAuth call.
Popups for OAuth should spawn separately after a user clicks ‚ÄúConnect,‚Äù not on startup.
Force Electron to show window (debugging):
Temporarily add mainWindow.show(); mainWindow.focus(); after creation.
This ensures Electron isn‚Äôt ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù due to ready-to-show not firing.
üîπ After Zencoder fixes:
Run:
```
cd c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-fixed
npm start

```
Expected terminal logs:
```
Environment validation passed
MODE: development
DEMO_MODE: true
SyncManager initialized
Electron loaded successfully
OAuth-Fixed main process setup complete
Configuration loaded: DEMO_MODE=true
Using Google Client ID: ...
Using Notion Client ID: ...
Main window visible

```
App UI window should appear with the dark border and correct standalone layout.

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on diagnosing and fixing a critical issue where the Synk Electron application was getting stuck during startup and not displaying the main window. The user provided comprehensive Zencoder instructions for implementing a complete OAuth-based sync application between Google Calendar and Notion.

**Initial Problem**: The app was launching successfully (showing environment validation and module initialization logs) but the main window never appeared, leaving the application in a "stuck" state.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Through systematic debugging, I discovered multiple critical issues:
1. Missing Electron app event handlers - the `app.whenReady()` callback was never properly set up
2. Duplicate `app.whenReady()` handlers causing conflicts
3. Syntax errors including an extra closing bracket that broke the code structure
4. The `setupIpcHandlers()` function was defined but never called

**Key Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Fixed App Launch**: Added proper Electron app event handlers with `app.whenReady()`, `app.on('window-all-closed')`, and `app.on('activate')` to ensure the main window is created and displayed
2. **Error Handling**: Added uncaught exception and unhandled rejection handlers to catch silent errors that could block the UI
3. **Window Fallback**: Implemented a 3-second timeout fallback to force show the window if `ready-to-show` event doesn't fire
4. **Environment Validation**: Enhanced validation to check both production and demo credentials based on DEMO_MODE
5. **Syntax Fixes**: Removed duplicate code blocks and fixed structural issues

**Zencoder Instructions Implementation**: Prior to fixing the launch issue, I had already implemented the complete Zencoder specification including:
- Environment and mode selection with fail-fast validation
- OAuth flows for both Google (PKCE) and Notion with proper popup windows
- Demo vs production behavior separation
- Auto-sync functionality without manual sync buttons
- Inline sync status display with timestamps
- Error handling with UI toast notifications
- Dark theme with Windows-style controls

**Technical Approach**: The debugging process involved examining the main process file structure, identifying missing event handlers, resolving syntax conflicts, and ensuring proper initialization order. The solution maintains the existing functionality while fixing the fundamental launch issue.

**Current Status**: The application structure is now properly configured with all necessary Electron event handlers in place. The last attempt still showed a syntax error ("Unexpected end of input"), indicating there may be one remaining unclosed function or bracket that needs to be resolved. However, all the major architectural issues have been identified and the solutions implemented.

**Key Insights**: This issue highlights the importance of proper Electron app lifecycle management and the need for systematic error handling in Electron applications. The debugging process revealed that even when modules initialize successfully, missing app event handlers can prevent the UI from ever appearing.
