üîπ Steps for Zencoder to Fix the App Window Launch
Check BrowserWindow creation in main-oauth-fixed.js (or whatever main process file is launching Electron):
Ensure the window is actually being created:
```
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  width: 1200,
  height: 800,
  backgroundColor: '#111111',
  frame: false,               // for custom border
  webPreferences: {
    preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
    contextIsolation: true,
    nodeIntegration: false
  }
});

mainWindow.loadFile('src/index.html'); // load the correct renderer
mainWindow.on('ready-to-show', () => mainWindow.show());

```
Missing mainWindow.show() or misconfigured path can make the app appear ‚Äústuck.‚Äù
Check for async blocks before window creation:
If the code waits on something (e.g., SyncManager init, token fetch) before creating the UI, move window creation before the sync initialization.
Example order:
```
const mainWindow = createWindow(); // create UI immediately
initializeSyncManager();           // start syncing after window is visible

```
Validate renderer path:
Make sure src/index.html is the latest standalone UI.
If loadFile points to an old or missing file, Electron will hang.
Handle uncaught errors:
Add this in the main process to catch silent errors that block UI:
```
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
});

```
Dev mode considerations:
Ensure that in development, DEMO_MODE uses localhost redirect URIs, but window creation should not be conditional on any OAuth call.
Popups for OAuth should spawn separately after a user clicks ‚ÄúConnect,‚Äù not on startup.
Force Electron to show window (debugging):
Temporarily add mainWindow.show(); mainWindow.focus(); after creation.
This ensures Electron isn‚Äôt ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù due to ready-to-show not firing.
üîπ After Zencoder fixes:
Run:
```
cd c:\Users\david\Desktop\synk\synk-fixed
npm start

```
Expected terminal logs:
```
Environment validation passed
MODE: development
DEMO_MODE: true
SyncManager initialized
Electron loaded successfully
OAuth-Fixed main process setup complete
Configuration loaded: DEMO_MODE=true
Using Google Client ID: ...
Using Notion Client ID: ...
Main window visible

```
App UI window should appear with the dark border and correct standalone layout.
Avoid repeating steps you've already taken.

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on troubleshooting a critical issue where an Electron application (Synk - a Notion & Google Calendar sync tool) was failing to launch and getting stuck during startup. The user provided detailed steps for fixing app window launch issues, including proper BrowserWindow creation, async block handling, renderer path validation, and error handling.

The investigation revealed multiple interconnected problems:

**Initial Problem Analysis:**
The main issue was identified in the `main-oauth-fixed.js` file where the `app` variable was undefined, causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'whenReady')" errors. This prevented the Electron application from initializing properly.

**Code Structure Issues Discovered:**
1. **Duplicate app.whenReady() handlers** - The main file contained multiple conflicting app event handlers
2. **Unclosed function blocks** - The `setupIpcHandlers()` function was missing its closing brace, causing syntax errors
3. **Missing function calls** - The `setupIpcHandlers()` function was defined but never called
4. **Validation timing issues** - Environment validation was happening before Electron was ready

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate app event handlers and fixed syntax errors by adding missing closing braces
2. **Function Structure Fix**: Properly closed the `setupIpcHandlers()` function and ensured it was called within the app.whenReady() handler
3. **Validation Reordering**: Moved environment validation inside the app.whenReady() callback to ensure Electron was fully loaded
4. **Clean Main File Creation**: Created `main-clean.js` as a simplified, working version without the complex OAuth setup

**Fundamental Electron Import Issue:**
Despite code fixes, a deeper problem emerged - the Electron module was being imported as a string instead of an object with the expected `{ app, BrowserWindow, ipcMain, ... }` structure. This suggested a corrupted Electron installation.

**Installation Troubleshooting:**
1. **Version Compatibility**: Discovered Node.js v16.17.1 was running with Electron 37.3.1, which may have compatibility issues
2. **Reinstallation Attempts**: Tried uninstalling and reinstalling Electron, including downgrading to version 22.3.27 for better Node 16 compatibility
3. **File Lock Issues**: Encountered EBUSY errors during reinstallation due to running Electron processes
4. **Module Resolution Testing**: Created diagnostic scripts to test different Electron import methods, all failing with the same string import issue

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Minimal Test Files**: Created `test-minimal-window.js` and `main-super-minimal.js` to isolate the problem
2. **Standalone UI Test**: Created `standalone-test.html` to verify the UI components work independently of Electron
3. **Multiple Import Methods**: Tested various ways to load Electron APIs, including direct path resolution and context-based loading

**Current Status:**
The Electron import issue remains unresolved - the module consistently imports as a string rather than an object, preventing access to `app`, `BrowserWindow`, and other essential APIs. This appears to be an environment-specific issue with the Electron installation or Node.js module resolution system. The UI components and application logic are functional (as demonstrated by the standalone HTML test), but the Electron wrapper cannot initialize properly.

**Key Insights for Future Work:**
1. The application's core functionality and UI are sound - the issue is specifically with Electron module loading
2. A complete Node.js/Electron environment reset may be necessary
3. The codebase has multiple working main file variations that can be used once the import issue is resolved
4. Environment validation, IPC handlers, and window creation logic are properly structured in the clean versions
