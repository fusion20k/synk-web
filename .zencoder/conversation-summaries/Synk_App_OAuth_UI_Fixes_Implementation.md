## Task State
working

## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on implementing comprehensive fixes for the Synk application (synk-fixed), an Electron-based tool that synchronizes Google Calendar with Notion databases. The work was a continuation of previous fixes, addressing critical OAuth, UI, and functionality issues according to detailed Zencoder instructions.

**Initial Context**: The conversation began with implementing 5 specific fixes that had been partially completed, requiring continuation and refinement to meet exact specifications.

**Key Fixes Implemented**:

1. **Fix #4 - Auto-Sync Selection Logic**: Completely overhauled the item selection system by converting calendar and database items from divs to proper button elements with ARIA labels and onclick handlers. Implemented a `toggleSelect()` function that allows single selection per side (one Google calendar, one Notion database) and triggers automatic sync after a 1.2-second debounce timer. Removed the unwanted properties panel that was opening on item clicks and replaced it with a clean auto-sync workflow.

2. **Centralized Configuration Management**: Updated the OAuth URL builder (`src/oauth-urls.js`) to use the centralized `isDemo()` function from `src/config.js` instead of the old config system. This ensures consistent demo/production mode handling across the entire application, with proper credential selection based on environment variables.

3. **UI Improvements**: Replaced the complex sync status panel with a simple inline status display that shows contextual messages like "Select one Notion database and one Google calendar to sync" or "Ready to sync - selections made". The status updates dynamically based on user selections and sync progress.

4. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Added a toast notification system for OAuth errors, specifically targeting redirect_uri_mismatch and client_id issues with the message "OAuth misconfigured: check redirect URIs and client IDs". This provides immediate user feedback when OAuth configuration problems occur.

5. **Sync Manager Updates**: Modified the sync manager to use the `SYNC_INTERVAL` environment variable (defaulting to 60 seconds) instead of hardcoded values, ensuring the auto-retry mechanism respects user configuration.

6. **Startup Logging**: Enhanced startup logging to show obfuscated credential information in the format specified by Zencoder instructions, displaying which Google and Notion client IDs are being used without exposing sensitive data.

**Technical Challenges Resolved**:
- Fixed syntax errors in the main process file where the `setupIpcHandlers` function was missing its closing brace
- Resolved duplicate Electron module imports that were causing startup failures
- Updated all OAuth handlers to use the centralized demo mode detection
- Ensured proper IPC handler registration for the new `startSync` functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `main-oauth-fixed.js`: Updated OAuth handlers, added startup logging, fixed syntax errors
- `src/index.html`: Converted items to buttons, implemented auto-sync logic, added toast notifications, simplified sync status UI
- `src/oauth-urls.js`: Centralized credential selection based on demo mode
- `src/syncManager.js`: Added environment variable support for sync intervals
- `src/preload.js`: Added `startSync` IPC exposure

**Current Status**: The application now successfully starts and implements all the required Zencoder specifications. The OAuth flows properly differentiate between demo and production modes, the UI provides clean item selection with auto-sync functionality, error handling shows appropriate user feedback, and the sync system respects environment configuration. The app maintains the dark theme with proper window styling and ensures popup windows don't close the main application.

**Key Insights**: The implementation demonstrates the importance of centralized configuration management in Electron applications, proper separation of demo and production environments, and the value of user-friendly error messaging for OAuth-related issues. The auto-sync approach eliminates user confusion by removing manual sync buttons and providing immediate feedback through inline status updates.
