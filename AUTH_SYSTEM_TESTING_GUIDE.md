# Dynamic Auth State Management - Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Static buttons always showed "Log In" and "Sign Up"
- Even when logged in, users still saw login buttons instead of account dropdown
- No dynamic state management

### Solution
- **Real Supabase Integration**: Now checks actual user session with `supabase.auth.getUser()`
- **Two Different UIs**:
  - **Logged Out**: Shows "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons (styled with theme colors)
  - **Logged In**: Shows user avatar with email and dropdown menu

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Avatar doesn't appear after login
**Solution:** Check console for errors. May need to wait 2-3 seconds for auth state to update.

### Problem: Dropdown doesn't open
**Solution:** Check console. Ensure Supabase client is initialized (look for "Supabase client initialized" message).

### Problem: Getting redirected to login from account page while logged in
**Solution:** Page might be checking auth before it's loaded. Wait 1-2 seconds, then refresh.

### Problem: Console shows 404 for auth-state-manager.js
**Solution:** File doesn't exist or wrong path. Check file exists at `/web/js/auth-state-manager.js`

### Problem: "Supabase library not loaded"
**Solution:** Supabase CDN not loading. Check internet connection and that script is in HTML head.
