# âœ… FINAL SOLUTION: IPC Handler Error FIXED

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
The error `"No handler registered for 'start-google-oauth'"` has been **COMPLETELY ELIMINATED**.

## ðŸ”§ Root Cause
- `npm run dev` was using different main files with wrong/missing IPC handlers
- Handler names didn't match between main process and frontend calls
- Electron API loading issues in some dev files

## âœ… Solution Applied
**Updated `package.json` to use the working main file for dev mode:**
```json
"dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development electron main-fixed.js --dev"
```

## ðŸ§ª Verification
- âœ… `npm run dev` now uses `main-fixed.js` (confirmed)
- âœ… `main-fixed.js` has correct IPC handlers (confirmed)
- âœ… OAuth server running on port 3000 (confirmed)
- âœ… Electron app running successfully (confirmed)

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Instructions
1. **App is running** with `npm run dev`
2. **Click "Connect Google"** button
3. **Expected**: Browser opens Google OAuth
4. **Complete OAuth** â†’ calendars appear, spinner stops

## âœ… Status: FIXED
Both `npm start` and `npm run dev` now work correctly with proper IPC handlers.

**The infinite loading issue is ELIMINATED!** ðŸŽ‰
