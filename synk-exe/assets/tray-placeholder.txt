PLACEHOLDER: Replace this file with a 16x16 or 32x32 PNG icon for the system tray.
The icon should be simple, monochrome, and work well in both light and dark system themes.
Suggested: A simple "S" letter or sync arrows icon.

For now, the app will try to load tray.png from this directory.
If the file doesn't exist, the tray will still work but without an icon.
