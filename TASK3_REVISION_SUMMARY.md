# TASK 3 REVISION: Professional Website Header with Auth States

## Overview
Completely revised the website header authentication UI to match the Dragon's Breath theme used throughout the app and website. The previous blue/white color scheme has been replaced with a professional dark theme featuring the signature orange/crimson gradient.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Auth Buttons Styling** (`css/styles.css`)
- **Login Button:**
  - Changed from generic white border to subtle dark theme with Dragon's Breath accents
  - Hover state now shows orange glow effect (`rgba(255, 69, 0, 0.08)` background)
  - Border color transitions to orange on hover
  - Added subtle box-shadow with orange glow

- **Sign Up Button:**
  - Updated to use `var(--gradient-primary)` (orange to crimson gradient)
  - Added shimmer effect on hover (matching CTA buttons throughout site)
  - Enhanced box-shadow with Dragon's Breath orange glow
  - Smooth transform animation on hover
  - Gradient transitions to `var(--gradient-secondary)` on hover

### 2. **User Avatar & Dropdown** (`css/styles.css`)

  - Increased size to 42px for better visibility
  - Added 2px border with orange accent color
  - Implemented glow effect using `::after` pseudo-element with blur
  - Enhanced hover state with scale transform and increased glow
  - Box-shadow uses Dragon's Breath orange color

  - Improved animation with scale transform for smoother appearance

  - Success notifications: Orange to crimson gradient

  - Added backdrop-filter blur for modern look
  - Enhanced box-shadow with orange accent
  - Improved border-radius to 12px for consistency
  - Added subtle white border for definition
  - Smoother cubic-bezier transition

### 4. **Responsive Design** (`css/styles.css`)
- **Mobile Optimization:**
  - Auth buttons remain visible on mobile (reduced padding and font-size)
  - User avatar scales down to 36px on mobile
  - Dropdown menu adjusts position for mobile screens
  - Maintained professional appearance across all screen sizes
  - Ensured touch targets are appropriately sized
